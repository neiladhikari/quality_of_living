GDP data in USD:
https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm

Finding GDP data is easy but finding it in the right format, currency or the way it is calculated can be challenging. I found it easier to pull it from OECD than IMF/IFS for this reason.

GDP approaches selected in this dataset:
output
expenditure
income
GDP currency: domestic as well as USD.

World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) also lists GDP data for all countries, until 2021, in USD, and offers easy, convenient downloads.

Make sure to download the GDP "per capita", not Total GDP or "Most Recent Value (Millions)"

What Is GDP Per Capita?
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is a financial metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a nation by its population.

How are the indicators normalised?

The Index gathers many indicators, expressed on very different units (dollars, years, etc). To compare and aggregate values expressed in different unities, the values have to be normalised.

This normalisation is done according to a standard formula which converts the original values of the indicators into numbers varying in a range between 0 (for the worst possible outcome) and 1 (for the best possible outcome). The formula is:
(value to convert – minimum value)/ (maximum value – minimum value)

When an indicator measures a negative component of well-being (e.g. unemployment) the formula used is:
1 – (value to convert – minimum value/maximum value – minimum value)
